"""T-244 backup→restore round-trip live integration test (opt-in).

Exercises the whole flow that previously had no integration coverage: ``run_backup_job`` →
``.tar.zst`` + manifest → ``new_database`` restore → pg_restore/analyze/smoke → compare the
original vs. restored ROW_COUNT_OBJECTS (10 objects). Opt-in via ``KTG_TEST_PG_DSN`` + the
backup CLI tools; it skips otherwise so CI stays green. The setup/backup/restore helpers in
``_backup_roundtrip`` are the fixture foundation for the T-245 fault-injection tests.

Point it at a local/dev PostGIS where your role has CREATEDB — the restore creates its own
target DB, which the shared :11000 instance's ``kor_travel_geo_app`` (NOCREATEDB) cannot do.
Run it with, e.g.:
    KTG_TEST_PG_DSN=postgresql+psycopg://<user>:<password>@127.0.0.1:<port>/kor_travel_geo_rt \
        pytest tests/integration/test_backup_restore_roundtrip.py -q
